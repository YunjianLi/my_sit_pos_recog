# my_sit_pos_recog
This repository include some code files and command text files guiding the operations of the python scripts.
This is not a complete project with a systematic structure. 
It's just a repo to put up part of the code files in my project which refered in one of my paper.
Therefore, the structure of this repo dosen't represent the real directory structure in my local project.
